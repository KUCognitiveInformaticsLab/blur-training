# analysis workspace

This is workspace for analyzing your trained models or making new test images. <br>

Basically you put and organize your codes in `../src/` modules, while you use this space for saving your results and plots. <br>
In doing so, you can put your codes for saving, plotting, configurations, and settings. <br>

Sometimes `../../src/` is used for reusing scripts.
